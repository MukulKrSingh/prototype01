# Step 1 Completion Summary

## Project Setup Successfully Completed

We have successfully completed Step 1 (Project Setup) of the E-commerce Backend Development project. All required tasks have been implemented according to the specifications in the COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md file.

### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **Go Module Initialization**
   - Created and configured go.mod with proper dependencies
   - Set up the module as github.com/prototype01

2. ✅ **GVM (Go Version Manager) Setup**
   - Added .gvmrc file specifying Go 1.22.5
   - Ensures consistent Go version across development environments

3. ✅ **Directory Structure**
   - Implemented standard Go project layout with proper separation of concerns:
     ```
     api/                    # API definitions (GraphQL schema)
     cmd/server/             # Application entry points
     internal/               # Private application code
       api/                  # GraphQL API handlers
       config/               # Configuration management
       domain/models/        # Domain models
       middleware/           # HTTP middleware
       repository/mongodb/   # Database operations
       service/              # Business logic services
     pkg/                    # Public libraries
       logger/               # Logging utilities
       utils/                # Common utilities
       validator/            # Data validation
     ```

4. ✅ **MongoDB Connection**
   - Set up MongoDB connection using the Atlas MCP connection string
   - Implemented connection handling with proper error management
   - Added configuration for database access

5. ✅ **Essential Packages**
   - Added all required dependencies:
     - github.com/joho/godotenv for configuration
     - go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver for database access
     - github.com/99designs/gqlgen for GraphQL (foundation only, to be expanded in Step 2)

6. ✅ **Additional Components**
   - Implemented configuration management with environment variables
   - Added logging functionality with different log levels
   - Created middleware for request logging and error recovery
   - Set up GraphQL placeholder structure for Step 2 implementation
   - Added utility packages for common functions
   - Implemented server with graceful shutdown

### Project Structure Overview

The project follows a clean architecture approach with:
- Clear separation of concerns between layers
- Domain models at the core
- Repository layer for data access
- Service layer for business logic (to be implemented in Step 2)
- API layer for external communication

### Next Steps (Step 2)

The following tasks are planned for the next step:
1. Design and implement database schema for e-commerce entities
2. Create detailed GraphQL schema definitions
3. Implement GraphQL resolvers and mutations
4. Set up authentication and authorization
5. Create product catalog and order processing systems

To proceed with Step 2, run the following command to generate the GraphQL code from our schema:
```bash
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate
```
