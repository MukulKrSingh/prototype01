# Project Setup Summary

## Completed Tasks from Step 1

1. **Go Module Initialization**
   - Created go.mod file with required dependencies
   - Set up module as github.com/prototype01

2. **GVM (Go Version Manager) Setup**
   - Added .gvmrc file specifying Go 1.22.5
   - This helps ensure consistent Go version across environments

3. **Directory Structure**
   - Created standard Go project layout:
     - `/api`: GraphQL schema definitions
     - `/apollo`: Apollo Studio configurations and example queries
     - `/cmd/server`: Application entry point
     - `/docs`: Project documentation
     - `/internal`: Private application code
       - `/api`: GraphQL API implementation
       - `/auth`: Authentication and authorization
       - `/config`: Configuration handling
       - `/domain`: Business logic and models
       - `/middleware`: HTTP middlewares
       - `/repository`: Database operations
     - `/pkg`: Reusable libraries
     - `/scripts`: Utility scripts for development and operations
     - `/api/schema`: GraphQL schema definition

4. **MongoDB Connection**
   - Set up MongoDB connection through MCP
   - Created repository interfaces and basic implementations
   - Integrated with existing MongoDB Atlas credentials

5. **Essential Packages**
   - Added key dependencies:
     - `github.com/99designs/gqlgen`: GraphQL code generation
     - `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver`: MongoDB driver
     - `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5`: JWT authentication
     - `github.com/joho/godotenv`: Environment configuration
     - `golang.org/x/crypto`: Password hashing

6. **GraphQL API**
   - Set up GraphQL schema and resolvers
   - Implemented GraphQL playground for development
   - Added Apollo Studio integration for enhanced API testing
   - Enabled introspection and automatic persisted queries
   - Implemented CORS middleware for Apollo Studio compatibility

7. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive project documentation
   - Added detailed GraphQL naming conventions
   - Documented project structure and architecture
   - Created Apollo Studio usage guide
   - Added example queries and mutations with standardized naming

## Next Steps

1. Design and implement database schema for e-commerce entities
2. Complete GraphQL resolvers based on the schema
3. Add authentication and authorization logic
4. Create product, order and user management systems
5. Implement data validation and error handling

## How to Proceed

Run the following command to generate GraphQL code from the schema:

```bash
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate
```

Then implement the resolvers to fulfill the GraphQL API requirements.
