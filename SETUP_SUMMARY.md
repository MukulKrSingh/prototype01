# Project Setup Summary

## Completed Tasks from Step 1

1. **Go Module Initialization**
   - Created go.mod file with required dependencies
   - Set up module as github.com/prototype01

2. **GVM (Go Version Manager) Setup**
   - Added .gvmrc file specifying Go 1.22.5
   - This helps ensure consistent Go version across environments

3. **Directory Structure**
   - Created standard Go project layout:
     - `/cmd/server`: Application entry point
     - `/internal`: Private application code
       - `/api`: GraphQL API implementation
       - `/config`: Configuration handling
       - `/domain`: Business logic and models
       - `/repository`: Database operations
     - `/pkg`: Reusable libraries
     - `/api/schema`: GraphQL schema definition

4. **MongoDB Connection**
   - Set up MongoDB connection through MCP
   - Created repository interfaces and basic implementations
   - Integrated with existing MongoDB Atlas credentials

5. **Essential Packages**
   - Added key dependencies:
     - `github.com/99designs/gqlgen`: GraphQL code generation
     - `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver`: MongoDB driver
     - `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5`: JWT authentication
     - `github.com/joho/godotenv`: Environment configuration
     - `golang.org/x/crypto`: Password hashing

## Next Steps

1. Design and implement database schema for e-commerce entities
2. Implement GraphQL resolvers based on the schema
3. Add authentication and authorization logic
4. Create product, order and user management systems

## How to Proceed

Run the following command to generate GraphQL code from the schema:

```bash
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate
```

Then implement the resolvers to fulfill the GraphQL API requirements.
