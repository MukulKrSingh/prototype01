# Project Fixes Summary

The following issues were identified and fixed in the project:

1. **Fixed Go Version Mismatch**
   - Updated the go.mod file to consistently use Go 1.22.5 as specified in the .gvmrc file
   - Removed the unnecessary toolchain directive

2. **Fixed Server Package Architecture**
   - Restructured cmd/server/main.go to export a RunServer function
   - Updated the main.go file in the root to properly invoke the server package
   - This ensures both direct execution (`go run cmd/server/main.go`) and indirect execution (`go run main.go`) work correctly

3. **Added Mock GraphQL Implementation**
   - Created placeholder generated files for GraphQL in internal/api/generated
   - This allows the application to compile and run without requiring full GraphQL code generation (which will be done in Step 2)
   - Updated handler.go to work with these mock files

4. **Updated Build Configuration**
   - Fixed the Makefile to correctly build the application from the main.go entry point
   - Added a run-bin target to build and run from the binary
   - Updated help documentation to reflect these changes

5. **Added Unit Test**
   - Added a simple unit test for the utils package to ensure testing works properly

6. **Fixed APQ Cache Issue**
   - Implemented an in-memory cache for Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ)
   - Resolved the "AutomaticPersistedQuery.Cache can not be nil" error
   - Created cache package in internal/api/cache with proper interface implementation
   - Added documentation in docs/cache-implementation.md

## Next Steps

The codebase is now fully functional for Step 1. To test it:

```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Run the built binary
make run-bin

# Or run directly (without building)
make run
```

When ready to proceed to Step 2, you can generate the GraphQL code with:

```bash
make generate
```
